# This is a Maximum/Minimum problem => Take search scope => 


# Ex: N = {12,34,67,90}, M=2
# APPROACH : 1. Identify search space (Here, Say M=N, then MINIMUM maximum no. of the pages which can be allocated is 90
#               and MAXIMUM maximum no. of pages are 203 when M=1. So SEARCH SPACE is between 90 and 203  )
#            2. Check conditions (here it is M students and each student should get atleast one book)
