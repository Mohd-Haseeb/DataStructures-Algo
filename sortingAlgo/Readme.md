# SORTING ALGORITHMS

- Sorting Algorithms are widely divided into two categories :
    1. Comparision based sorting

    2. Non-omparision based sorting


- In Comparision based sorting, we compare the elements inside the array. But in Non-comparision based sorting, we don not oompmare within the elements.

## Comparision based :

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell sort


## Non-comparision based :
- Count Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort



### __Stable Sort__ :

Ex : arr = [20, 10', 50, 9, 10'', 12]

    Sorted output = [9, 10', 10'', 12, 20, 50]

-> If the element is repeating more than once in an array and retains its Original order after sorting, we call it Stable sort.

### __Unstable Sort__ :

Ex : arr = [20, 10', 50, 9, 10'', 12]

    Sorted output = [9, 10'', 10', 12, 20, 50]

-> If the element is repeating more than once in an array and doesn't retains its Original order after sorting, we call it unstable sort. Ex : QUick sort and Heap Sort



### __Inplace and Outplace Sorting Algorithms__

Inplace -> No extra space

Outplace -> Extra space is taken by the algo. Creates a new array.
